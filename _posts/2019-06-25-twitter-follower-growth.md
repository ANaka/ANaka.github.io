Starting at the beginning of May, I've had a script running on an AWS EC2 instance that queries Twitter's API every minute to monitor the follower counts of the Democratic presidential candidates for the 2020 election. It's starting to get to be a pretty decent amount of data - I'll have to do a serious analysis soon. 

This is mostly meant as a `hello world` post for the blog, but to put a little meat in here, here's a plot of the change in follower counts for who I consider to be the top 5 contenders right now.

I've also been tracking my own followers for almost as long.

Looks like I had a little dip in my numbers on 5/13, I wonder if it was something I said. But overall not too shabby, at least in a relative sense. 

I'm going to have to pick up the pace if I ever want to catch up though!
