Starting at the beginning of May, I've been monitoring the follower counts of the Democratic presidential candidates for the 2020 election using a script that queries Twitter's API once a minute. It's starting to accumulate a pretty decent amount of data - I'll have to do a serious analysis soon. 

This is mostly meant as a `hello world` post for the blog, but to put a little meat in here, here's a plot of the change in follower counts for who I consider to be the top 5 contenders right now.

I've also been tracking my own followers for almost as long. I'll indulge in a litle navel-gazing, since today I cracked 1500 followers.

Looks like I had a little dip in my numbers on 5/13, I wonder if it was something I said. But overall not too shabby, at least in a relative sense. 

I'm going to have to pick up the pace if I ever want to catch up though!

## Edit:

Hah, I went back and looked at what I tweeted around 5/13. Turns out the evening of 5/12 I posted a meme on behalf of a friend, [Charles Frye](https://charlesfrye.github.io/), who made it immediately after we watched a new episode of Game of Thrones together.

It was a bit of a dud. Could it be Charlie's fault that these people unfollowed me? Impossible to say. 

In his defense, we weren't the only people thinking along these lines.

Maybe it's a sign that I need to stick to posting science stuff.
