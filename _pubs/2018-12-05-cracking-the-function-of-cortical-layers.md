Understanding how cortical activity generates sensory perceptions requires a detailed dissection of the function of cortical layers. Despite our relatively extensive knowledge of their anatomy and wiring, we have a limited grasp of what each layer contributes to cortical computation. We need to develop a theory of cortical function that is rooted solidly in each layerâ€™s component cell types and fine circuit architecture and produces predictions that can be validated by specific perturbations. Here we briefly review the progress toward such a theory and suggest an experimental road map toward this goal. We discuss new methods for the all-optical interrogation of cortical layers, for correlating in vivo function with precise identification of transcriptional cell type, and for mapping local and long-range activity in vivo with synaptic resolution. The new technologies that can crack the function of cortical layers are finally on the immediate horizon.
